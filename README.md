# amortization-calculator

I created an amoritazation calculator in Python using the Pandas module to display data. For this program I utilized dictionaries to hold the data related to principal, interest, and payment information based on the loan amount, interest rate, and term of the loan input from the user. The program also has the ability to download the information generated by the tables using the Pandas module in a CSV file. Those lines of code are commented out currently but work properly.
